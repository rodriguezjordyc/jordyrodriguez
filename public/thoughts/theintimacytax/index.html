                    <h2><strong>The Hidden Transaction</strong></h2><p>In our physical world, we know what our money gets us. When we pay $3 for a water bottle, we expect hydration. When we pay $100 for a manicure, we expect polished, professional results. In the introduction to Modern Stewardship, I explained how our engagement has become the currency in our digital world. But unlike physical transactions where expectations are clear, our digital transactions remain cloudy—and it has consequences for how we practice stewardship in our modern lives.</p><p>Unlike a sales tax that's clearly defined in our receipts, this digital tax remains invisible—collected with every scroll, click, and conversation. What makes this particularly significant is that the price we pay to access online platforms creates a fundamental misalignment: we don't know what to expect from platforms that know so much about us.</p><h2><strong>No Free Lunch</strong></h2><p>When we scroll through our favorite "free" apps, we're actually paying a price—a kind of tax on our digital lives. Beyond time and attention, we pay our platforms with data. While this model has been widely debated in policy circles, the significant personal implications of this transaction remain largely unexamined in our daily lives.</p><p>What starts as a simple data transaction to keep our technology "free" becomes an intimate portrait of who we are—our desires, insecurities, and aspirations. But AI amplifies this intimacy to unprecedented levels.</p><p>AI systems operate on "context" and "memory"—friendly ways of saying data, though <em>deeply personal</em> data. In traditional web or mobile experiences, the data we share is based on actions: whose profile you visit, what you click, which links you follow. While useful, these actions miss the rich details of human experience. But when you interact with AI systems, you fill in those blanks—sharing your thought processes, emotions, and reasoning. The information your AI system collects reveals not just what you do, but how you think.</p><p>I experience this firsthand. While reading, I often have an AI chatbot assist me by keeping it open alongside my book or article. I can pause to explore ideas, ask questions when concepts don't click, or work through challenging passages in real-time. It enriches my reading experience. But in these conversations, the system learns my communication style, how I process information, what confuses me, and my emotional reactions to challenges. AI doesn't just learn what I read—it learns how my mind works while I'm reading.</p><p>Meanwhile, others share even more intimate aspects of their lives with AI systems—conversations about dating, interpersonal conflict, mental health, and marriage. The price of AI's services is our most vulnerable selves—a tax paid not in dollars, but in the intimate details of how we think, feel, and process the world around us.</p><h2><strong>Reclaiming Our Expectations</strong></h2><p>Understanding the access we grant our technologies is the foundation of modern stewardship. Given what we sacrifice—our attention, data, and now our innermost thoughts—we deserve technology that serves our deeper purposes.</p><p>Tech companies have largely defined these expectations for us through different marketing strategies. When marketing to consumers, they sell aspirational promises: connection, love, family, wealth. But marketing materials intended for businesses focus on concrete outcomes: return on investment, cost savings, time saved, and customer satisfaction. Companies purchasing software understand that poor choices impact profit, employee productivity, and reputation.</p><p>While businesses have clear metrics, universal metrics don't exist at the human level. Each of us values different outcomes: deeper connections with our partners, a sense of purpose in our work, confidence from physical health, peace of mind from financial security, or the fulfillment of creative expression. This complexity means we must actively evaluate whether our daily technologies bring us closer to or farther from what matters most.</p><p>Consider how AI might reshape our closest relationships. We might use AI to help process a difficult conversation with our partner, getting suggestions for how to communicate more effectively. This could genuinely improve our relationships—helping us express feelings we struggle to articulate. Or it might create a subtle dependency where we lose confidence in our own emotional intelligence. The same tool could strengthen or weaken the very connections we value most, depending on how we use it.</p><p>Modern stewardship means asking ourselves these hard questions about every platform we use. Instead of accepting what technology promises us, we define what we need from it—especially as AI systems demand more intimate access to our lives.</p><h2><strong>The Path Forward</strong></h2><p>The transaction between us and our technology isn't going away—if anything, AI will make it more widespread. This intimacy tax will only grow steeper as AI systems become more sophisticated. But recognizing this transaction is the first step toward true stewardship. When we understand the real price we're paying, we can make informed decisions about whether that price aligns with our values and goals.</p><p>This isn't about rejecting technology or becoming paranoid about data collection. It's about making intentional choices. Looking beneath the surface of our digital interactions can help us build a foundation that <em>benefits</em> from technological change.</p><p>The question isn't whether we'll use AI. The question is whether we'll use it as stewards who understand the true nature of the exchange, or as consumers who trade away pieces of ourselves without ever counting the cost.</p>
