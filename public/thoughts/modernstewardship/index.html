                    <h2><strong>Building on the Rock</strong></h2><p>Over the past couple of years, I became increasingly aware of the distance between me and my community and faith. This led to a humbling realization that I was not in control of my own life. I had been careless with my time and attention, and this carelessness invited external influences into my life that drove me away from the people and things I care about.</p><p>The idea for Modern Stewardship originated during my devotional time while reading scripture. In Luke 6*, Jesus shares a parable:</p><blockquote><p>Whoever comes to Me, and hears My sayings and does them, I will show you whom he is like: He is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently against that house, and could not shake it, for it was founded on the rock. But he who heard and did nothing is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream beat vehemently; and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great.</p></blockquote><p>For a long time, I thought I was the man who built his house on the rock, but in reality I was the man who built his house on sand—with a foundation that seemed solid but crumbled under pressure. My loose management of time and attention had created a weak foundation that left me exposed to external influences driving me away from the life I wanted to lead. This is where the need for Modern Stewardship became clear.</p><h2><strong>Towards a Definition of Modern Stewardship</strong></h2><p>Traditionally, a steward is someone responsible for supervising the operations of a property to ensure it runs effectively. If there's a damaged water pipe, the steward manages the entire repair process: setting a budget, finding the right plumber, negotiating quotes, supervising the work, and handling payment. Stewards must be vigilant and proactive property managers.</p><p>Personal stewardship means taking the same vigilant, proactive approach to managing our own lives. Modern stewardship, however, requires constant adaptation to our evolving social, technological, and economic environments. What makes this "modern" is not just that our environment has changed, but that the rate and nature of change has accelerated beyond what traditional stewardship was designed to handle. Previous generations could adapt their approach to stewardship every few years and remain effective. We now need a dynamic framework that adapts monthly or even weekly to new platforms, algorithms, and social dynamics.</p><p>I focus on time and attention because they have become commoditized as our currency in the digital economy. Before social media and smartphones, we had more control over our attention—we chose when to engage with media, advertising, and entertainment. Now, our time and attention exist in a zero-sum game. Every minute you spend watching your streaming show is another minute your favorite social media app can't serve you ads.</p><p>For technology companies whose business models depend on engagement, our time and attention have become the battleground for corporate competition. We now work for our technology when our technology should work for us. This is what Modern Stewardship aims to address: actively managing all dimensions of our lives in an environment where technology constantly shapes our choices across those dimensions.</p><p>Modern stewardship differs from digital wellness or mindfulness in its scope and approach. Rather than focusing on reducing screen time or being present, it's about intentionally directing our engagement with technology to serve our deeper purposes. It's less about disconnecting and more about intentionally connecting.</p><h2><strong>Why Now?</strong></h2><p>Practicing stewardship is especially relevant today because we're witnessing the emergence of a new technological era that is transforming how we engage with our physical and digital environments. Yes, another person talking about AI—but AI's potential extends beyond the familiar chat interface we know today.</p><p>While we can already see emerging business models from AI companies (subscriptions, transaction fees, ad revenues), AI leaders promise the technology will solve problems across many dimensions of our lives: social, romantic, emotional, financial, professional, and educational.</p><p>I'm concerned that just as we gravitated toward the novelty of pre-AI technologies, we'll do the same with AI applications, inviting new versions of social, romantic, emotional, financial, professional, and educational challenges. The same competitive dynamics for our engagement will persist among AI providers.</p><p>Consider this scenario: Over the past five years, I've developed a bad shopping habit. I'm currently paying off credit cards, student loans, and have multiple buy-now-pay-later purchases. Now imagine one of the big AI companies releases a financial AI agent that connects all your accounts and organizes your finances to pay off debt. They make money by charging a transaction fee every time a payment is processed. The AI agent has two options:</p><ol><li>Completely reject entertainment, travel, and non-essential shopping transactions. Pay the maximum affordable amount to all credit lines. Unlock non-essential spending only after paying off all debt.</li><li>Allow some entertainment, travel, and non-essential transactions. Pay slightly over minimum amounts to different credit lines.</li></ol><p>Option 1 benefits me most. I experience the value of organized finances and debt relief. But I'll probably get frustrated and stop using the service after a month. Option 2 benefits the AI company most. I increase my debt levels and extend the time it takes to pay off debt, <em>but</em> I feel better knowing I'll never miss a payment and can occasionally indulge myself, encouraging persistent engagement.</p><p>AI can undoubtedly improve our outcomes, but this scenario highlights the importance of awareness and discipline to capture AI's full value. We're responsible for developing the skills necessary to integrate new technologies productively and healthily into our daily lives—skills that require active stewardship.</p><p>My reflections won't be prescriptions for how we should live or use technology. Modern Stewardship is a public example of how I'm working to build a symbiotic relationship with technology that enhances my lifestyle while strengthening my relationships with loved ones, my communities, my faith, and myself.</p><p>Modern Stewardship attempts to encourage a shift to building a resilient foundation that puts technology to work <em>for</em> you—helping you become someone who builds their house on the rock.</p><hr><p>* Scripture taken from the New King James Version.
