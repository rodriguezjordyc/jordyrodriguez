                    <p>Supporting Real Madrid was difficult this season for multiple reasons. Among them was the visible dysfunction of the team in the midst of an injury list the length of a CVS receipt. Seeing Madrid’s striker line filled with heavyweights (Jude, Mbappe, Vini, and Rodrygo) trying to play with a limited defense and midfield made me question whether Ancelotti’s management team did the best with what he had or did the best with what he knew. The experience-based approach to football will always matter, but it has become just as important to incorporate quantitative analyses into football in order to maximize the squad’s potential.</p><p>While there is an existing, strong sports analytics market, football has been a relatively slow sport to integrate complex data science methods into teams’ operations given the sports dynamism, love for tradition, and rapid commercialization. While the latter two are just as important to the resistance of “intellectualization”* of the sport, they are out of scope for the ideas I am currently exploring in this reflection.</p><p>Football matches can be better studied through complex science, opening the door for new scientific frameworks to understand and elevate the beautiful game. <a href="https://sfi-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/sfi-edu/production/uploads/publication/2016/10/31/summer_fall1987v2n1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Holland</a> - widely accepted as the pioneer of complex adaptive systems - validates CAS through two high-level characteristics: hierarchical organization and building blocks and system-environment interaction. I’d like to perform an exercise to validate football as a complex system by applying Holland’s definition of CAS.</p><ul><li><strong>Hierarchical Organization and Building Blocks</strong><ul><li>A football match can be described as a competitive interaction between two teams. Each team on the pitch is composed of the coaching staff and player squad. The squad is generally is organized with defensive, midfield, and attacking groups, which are composed of individual players.</li></ul></li><li><strong>System-Environment Interaction</strong><ul><li>In a football match, the environment is the pitch, the rulebook, and the referee. During a match, two systems compete with each other by coordinating with their team through a sequence of actions to achieve a payoff.</li><li>Teams and individuals have access to a wide range of regularities in a football match that they can exploit through diverse action sequences, or strategies, to achieve desired outcome(s). In any given game, teams only explore a subset of the infinitely many possibilities.</li><li>Although football commentators and analysts haven’t adopted explore and exploit as terms to describe teams’ initial strategies, it is well documented that teams sometimes begin matches slowly out of caution for the attacking team, delaying a payout while they explore the opposing team’s landscape. In competitive football, however, teams continuously explore various strategies to penetrate the opposing team’s weaknesses before exploiting.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Emergent behavior in football has always made it difficult to defend traditional metrics used to study players: goals, passes, assists, shots on target, recoveries, goals against, passes, possession, among others. These statistics provide an aggregate snapshot but are reductive. Assists, for example, are typically a metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of a midfielder. But it ignores the team’s system and the player’s role in that system and the interdependencies associated with the midfield**.</p><p>Complexity science and its quantitative methods create an opportunity to identify more holistic and effective metrics that incorporate the dynamism of the sport to measure the team and players’ performance. As the data and digital infrastructure layer in football develops, the utility of complexity science in the beautiful game is increasingly clear. Stats padding to build marketable stars is a symptom of wider commercialization efforts in the sport - distancing football from its roots. Complexity science is traditionally applied in physical and social sciences, but it has the potential help football return to fundamentals and elevate the game.</p><hr><p>* Important to note that there is a universe of quantitatively inclined football fans, but they generally allocate their time understanding the game through data for fantasy games or betting. I am exclusively talking about the slow adoption of data into football organizations’ operations at the federation (e.g. UEFA), league (e.g. Liga MX), and club (e.g. Real Madrid) levels.</p><p>** One visual that illustrates this idea is a comparison of Jude and Pedri’s stats. Unique players that differ in ability, style, and contributions but play similar position in their respective teams; however, Barcelona and Real Madrid have dramatically different systems, which reflects in their individual statistics.</p><img src="/images/24f79889-bbb1-8130-9fcb-f31ae5cdabdd.png" alt="" /><img src="/images/24f79889-bbb1-810c-a37f-f54596c88aea.png" alt="" />
