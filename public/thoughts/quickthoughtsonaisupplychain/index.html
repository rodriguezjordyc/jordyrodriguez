                    <p><em>I wrote this analysis last year while trying to understand the AI supply chain. Publicly sharing notes I wrote for myself below:</em></p><hr><p>I've been trying to understand the supply chain that enables the commercial deployment of AI systems. The growing interest in AI from enterprises and consumers has been catalyzed by GenAI models from a select number of companies: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft.</p><p>The rapid growth of AI adoption has mainly been centered around the suppliers of foundational models (e.g. GPT-4) and firms building domain-specific applications powered by foundational models (e.g. chatbots, virtual assistants). However, this overlooks the various stakeholders within the supply chain that help train, fine-tune, integrate, deploy, and manage AI systems for the best end-user experience. The current state of AI deployment is reminiscent of the early days in IT services outsourcing.</p><p><strong>Opportunity for Latin America</strong></p><p>Given the existing growth of LLMs and adjacent foundational models is a result of decades of R&D from major U.S. and Chinese companies and universities, there is an opportunity for Latin America to build companies that enable and manage the efficient deployment of AI systems for enterprises in the region and globally.</p><p>Below is a quick categorization of different areas in the supply chain from upstream to downstream stages of AI development and deployment (this is the first attempt at organizing different literature, so it is subject to change). There is a unique space for domain-focused AI startups and AI infrastructure startups to create AI tools / services that are tailored to Latin American business practices and contextual consumer preferences. Additionally, there will soon be an interest in managing non-modular AI services and measuring the efficacy of systems.</p><hr><p><strong>AI Supply Chain Categories (Upstream to Downstream)</strong></p><table data-has-row-header="true"><tbody><tr><th>Data Providers</th><td>Companies collecting, aggregating, labelling, and selling data for model training</td></tr><tr><th>Foundational Model Creators</th><td>Companies building and licensing proprietary AI / ML models (domain agnostic)</td></tr><tr><th>Domain-focused App Developers</th><td>Companies fine-tuning foundational models and applications for enterprise or consumer use-cases</td></tr><tr><th>AI Infra Providers</th><td>Companies facilitating the deployment & management of AI / ML systems for model creators or enterprises</td></tr><tr><th>End-user</th><td>Enterprises or consumers</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><p><strong>Supply Chain Complexity</strong></p><p>The interactions between stakeholders across the supply chain cannot be easily mapped because they are not as linear as traditional supply chains. For example, End-users, such as enterprises, may directly license from Foundational Model Providers, eliminating Domain-focused Application Developers from the equation. What is certain, however, is the value creation across all levels of the supply chain. Stanford's research on foundational model ecosystems illustrates these complex connections between stakeholders.</p><p><strong>Objective and Scope</strong></p><p>The objective of this quick summary is to help categorize the levels of AI development and deployment, as there is value yet to be unlocked across the supply chain. A follow-up to this is a market map similar to one created by the Madry Lab at MIT for companies in Latin America and a better understanding of the physical infrastructure supply chain that enables AI deployment in the region.</p><p>This view excludes the physical infrastructure necessary for energy-efficient, performance-maximizing deployments: GPUs, semiconductors, data centers, cloud services, fiber / 5G networks, and advanced energy technologies, among others. The physical infrastructure layer represents another massive opportunity, especially as current demand far exceeds supply capacity.</p>
